![Sapphire style for K2 in action](/static/uploads/2007/04/sapphire-for-k2-in-action.png)

I've just release a new version of [my Sapphire adaptation for K2 theme](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2007/03/sapphire-style-for-k2-wordpress-theme/). This second release not only fix margins regarding the main layout, but also styles of blockquotes and lists (to render them consistently in comments).

Here is a [direct download link to this v0.2](http://kevin.deldycke.com/static/wordpress/wordpress-k2-style-sapphire-0.2.zip).
