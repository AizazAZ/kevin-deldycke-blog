During the first (cold) hours of 2010, I've [done some light painting](http://maomium.com/light-painting-part-one/) compositions with a friend. Discovering he was into this stuff and having my [Canon 7D DSLR](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NEGTTW/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kevideld-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399381&creativeASIN=B002NEGTTW) at hand, we decided to improvise a little session of long exposure shots. Here is a sample of photos we've took:![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kevideld-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002NEGTTW&camp=217145&creative=399381)
