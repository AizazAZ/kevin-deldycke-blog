  * Change the keyboard layout in Debian (don't forget to logoff and logon to activate the new setting):

        :::console
        dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration

  * Low-level format of the `hda` device:

        :::console
        dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda

  * Same as above but for parano√Ød, as random bits will be written 3 times before performing the "low-level format" (i.e. writting zeros):

        :::console
        shred --verbose --force --iterations=3 --zero /dev/hda

  * Remove the MBR:

        :::console
        dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/hda bs=446 count=1

  * Restore the original Windows MBR:

        :::console
        apt-get install mbr
        install-mbr -i n -p D -t 0 /dev/hda

  * Guess the partition table of a device, including damaged ones:

        :::console
        gpart -v /dev/md0

  * To add touchpad kernel support, add the following option to kernel at boot time:

        :::console
        psmouse.proto=imps

  * Sometimes, depending of the laptop I use, the mouse pointer disappear from the screen when I plug a VGA cable to a projector. In this case, I do a `CTRL + ALT + F1`, then I login as a normal user and finally I start a new X session:

        :::console
        startx -- :1
