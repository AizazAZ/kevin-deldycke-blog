By randomly browsing the net, I've found a [cloud photo from Croatia](http://tallecreative.com/designmudd/2005/06/13/croatia-pics/) which look like the one I put as a header of this blog.

Of course the picture is not the same, because my clouds are from North of France. Just a funny coincidence...
