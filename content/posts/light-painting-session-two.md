Here is another light painting session I've done 2 weeks ago with Jim:

This time we used a more powerfull light source: a simple [Apple's iPhone](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AXA056/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kevideld-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B001AXA056) at full brightness.

 We also played with several colors, thanks to the [free Flashlight app](http://itunes.apple.com/app/flashlight/id285281827).

Check out the entire set of photos on his photo gallery.
