Here is my [latest version (0.4) of Sapphire](http://kevin.deldycke.com/static/wordpress/wordpress-k2-style-sapphire-0.4.zip) for K2. This version fix the style to let it work with the [Release Candidate 3 of K2](http://getk2.com/2007/10/k2-release-candidate-3-released/).

It also include some CSS backports from K2 v0.9.6, especially the CSS trick that automaticcaly resize your big images to fit the weight of the  central theme column.
