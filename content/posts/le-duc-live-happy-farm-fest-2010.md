Here is an unedited video of [Le Duc](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=20312134675), a band I shot last week at [Happy Farm Fest 2010](http://happyfarmfest.com) with my [Canon 7D](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NEGTTW/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kevideld-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399381&creativeASIN=B002NEGTTW) and a [Sigma 30mm f/1.4 EX DC HSM](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007U0GZM/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kevideld-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399381&creativeASIN=B0007U0GZM) wide open:

This was shot in 1080p at 25 fps (to reduce light flickering) without any stabilization device. I may have use my [LCD ViewFinder](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003A2BU5E/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kevideld-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399381&creativeASIN=B003A2BU5E) but I have no clear memory of this. Shutter speed was 1/50 and ISO set to auto.



I'm shooting video with my 7D for 7 months now and I think that's the first time one of my shot is made public. That's quite depressing as I still have tons of raw video to edit for several projects, but can't go ahead because of a [bad MacBook Pro](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2009/12/macosx-is-irritating/#comment-7158)...
