Here is the ultimate version of Amarok ! The [version 1.4.4 of Amarok was released today](http://amarok.kde.org/content/view/84/66/), and I've added it to [my brand new Mandriva 2007 repository](http://kevin.deldycke.com/mandriva-rpm-repository/). As a bonus, this RPM support three database system to store audio collections: SQLite (default), MySQL and Postgresql.

I've noticed that MusicBrainz features are broken in the default Amarok 1.4.3 which come with Mandriva 2007. Unfortunately, those features are still broken in this release. Sorry.
