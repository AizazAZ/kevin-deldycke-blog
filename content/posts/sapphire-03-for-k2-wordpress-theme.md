I've updated [my Sapphire adaptation](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2007/03/sapphire-style-for-k2-wordpress-theme/) for the [new K2 v0.9.6 release](http://getk2.com/2007/06/k2-v096-released/).

Sapphire 0.3 is now compatible with K2 sidebars, which mean that the header and footer of the theme will be expanded or reduced according to the number of sidebars. To achieve this flexibility, I had to redo all images included in the original Sapphire theme. All Inkscape and Gimp source files can be found in the "`sources`" folder of the [Sapphire v0.3 zip file](http://kevin.deldycke.com/static/wordpress/wordpress-k2-style-sapphire-0.3.zip). This total rework also mean that I no longer use any file or code from the legacy sapphire theme.
