Here is an optical illusion I generated with [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org). I created this file some years ago and found it recently while cleaning my archives.

Using a contrast trick it appears that [circles are in motions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_illusion). Click on the image below to get a full-size preview:

And as the title say, you can [download my original SVG source file](http://kevin.deldycke.com/static/documents/optical-illusion-circles-in-motion.svgz) (released under a [Creative Commons BY-SA license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)).
