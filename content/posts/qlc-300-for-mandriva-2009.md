[![qlc-3-on-mandriva-2009](http://kevin.deldycke.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/qlc-3-on-mandriva-2009-150x150.png)](http://kevin.deldycke.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/qlc-3-on-mandriva-2009.png) I've upgraded [my old QLC RPM](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2008/05/qlc-2-6-1-for-mandriva-2008-1/) to [the 3.0.0 version](http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=930755). This release is built for Mandriva 2009.1 and x86_64 architecture only, and do not depends on LLA. I also had to remove the FTDI output plugin as it doesn't compile on my machine. You can find the [QLC RPM in my repository](http://kevin.deldycke.com/static/repository/mandriva/2009.1/x86_64/).

In the end, this RPM is quite a prototype. I didn't checked that it works well beyond the UI (check the screenshot for a proof). So use it at your own risks !
